## Interface Definition Language (.idl)
    IDL (Interface Definition Language) files in C++ projects are used to define interfaces for communication between different components, often in distributed systems or applications using RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls). These files describe methods, interfaces, and data structures independently of any specific programming language. An IDL compiler then processes the file to generate language-specific code (e.g., `.h` and `.cpp` files for C++), enabling interoperability between components, even if they are written in different languages or located on separate systems.
